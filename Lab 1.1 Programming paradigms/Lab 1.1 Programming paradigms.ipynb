    "For example, in Python, it's possible to write code in a procedural/imperative style, functional style, object-oriented style, or in some mixture of different styles. In fact, many programmers write code that would be considered a blend of paradigms; high-quality code usually tries to combine the strengths of different paradigms, depending on the situation.\n",
